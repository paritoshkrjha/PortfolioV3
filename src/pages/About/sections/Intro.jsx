      Hi there!
      <br /> I’m Paritosh, a software developer who’s passionate about creating
      impactful, user-centric applications. With a strong foundation in{' '}
      <span className="font-bold text-white">Flutter</span> and
      <span className="font-bold text-white"> MERN stack</span>, I enjoy the challenge of
      transforming complex problems into elegant solutions.
      <br />
      When I’m not coding, I’m diving into the latest tech trends, reading up on
      new ideas, or enjoying some downtime with music. I believe in the power of
      simplicity and strive to bring that into my work, ensuring that what I
      build is both functional and enjoyable.
      <br />
      If you’re looking for someone who’s dedicated, curious, and ready to make
      a difference, <span className="font-bold text-white">let’s connect!</span>
